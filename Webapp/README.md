# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080//ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080//swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```

## Running with WSGI

For running in production on a server you should first install `gunicorn` with `pip install gunicorn`.

Then, from the `Webapp` directory you should run:

```
exec gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:sofia.sock -m 007 wsgi
```

You will need to configure NGINX to use the config called `sofia` contained in this directory and you may need to ensure that the NGINX workers can access the `sofia.sock` file that is created. You should put the `sofia` file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and symlink it to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. To test the NGINX config use:

```
sudo nginx -t
```

If the config is acceptable then reload NGINX with:

```
sudo nginx -s reload
```

## Authentification
This application currently uses [Flask-BasicAuth](https://flask-basicauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Before running the app you should configure the username and password in `config.ini`.
